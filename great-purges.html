  <p>
    This essay aims to provide an accurate account of the Great Purges in the USSR in the 1930s by examining the modern academic research on the topic and applying a Marxist analysis to understand exactly what happened, why it happened and what went wrong. As discussed later in this essay, the prevailing popular narrative is rife with inaccuracies and does not hold up to modern historical research, and it is the purpose of this work to provide a more accurate understanding of this important period in Soviet history.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to understand the so-called Great Purges, it is important to first of all understand what is meant by this overly broad term, for there are several distinct events from 1934 to 1938 that are misguidedly lumped together in typical narratives of this period of Soviet history. As explained later in this essay, regular purges — <em>chistki</em> — were carried out within the Communist Party to remove inactive or unreliable members, such as drunken officials or people with forged identification. It is important to clarify that the word "purge", despite ominous connotations, did not mean execution — it simply meant expulsion from the party, which can happen for a variety of benign reasons. It was only until 1937, during the <strong>Yezhovshchina</strong>, where widespread repression began and this must be distinguished from previous routine purges. It is this period in particular that the bulk of our analysis is directed at.
  </p>

  <p>
    Contrary to the popular anticommunist view, the Great Purges were not a plot hatched to eradicate all opposition to the party line; rather, the weight of academic research suggests that this period was a far more chaotic time than originally understood and the purges did not follow some centralised plan of action.<a href="#fn-1" id="ref-1" class="fn">[1]</a> It was far more decentralised than anything, with local party and government organisations zealously acting on their own initiative, often with the <em>disapproval</em> of the central authorities.<a href="#fn-2" id="ref-2" class="fn">[2]</a> This was further exacerbated by the widespread paranoia of a possible invasion — which followed in 1941 — and internal threats. The emphasis of Stalin and the party leadership was not on mass arrests and executions but rather reeducation and stricter party admission guidelines. He struggled against witch hunts based on former associations with oppositionists<a href="#fn-3" id="ref-3" class="fn">[3]</a> and repeatedly demanded that cadres be assessed based on their individual merits.<a href="#fn-4" id="ref-4" class="fn">[4]</a><a href="#fn-5" id="ref-5" class="fn">[5]</a><a href="#fn-6" id="ref-6" class="fn">[6]</a> Mass repression campaigns like that against kulaks in 1937 were not favoured by Stalin, as they caused chaos and impeded his efforts to centralise administration.<a href="#fn-7" id="ref-7" class="fn">[7]</a> In fact, the campaign against kulaks was demanded by local party leaders, as they feared the impact of the political rights granted to kulaks by the 1936 constitution.<a href="#fn-8" id="ref-8" class="fn">[8]</a> NKVD Order No. 447 also set limits — often misrepresented in literature as "quotas" — on those that could be executed despite the resistance of local authorities, who exceeded the limits in many instances.<a href="#fn-9" id="ref-9" class="fn">[9]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Stalin was reacting to developments as they occurred, and there is no evidence of him masterminding a plot to repress all opposition.<a href="#fn-10" id="ref-10" class="fn">[10]</a> The general trend of the state in the 1930s was towards greater leniency following the completion of collectivisation, not more repression, and this can be seen from statistics regarding arrests and convictions, which greatly decreased from 1930–1936, as well as the reform and reduction in powers of the police.<a href="#fn-11" id="ref-11" class="fn">[11]</a> Stalin had desired to expand democracy in the USSR with the 1936 constitution, introducing secret and direct elections with universal suffrage to the Supreme Soviet (rather than the prior indirect elections to the Congresses of Soviets), removing the earlier restrictions for kulaks and NEPmen which were no longer considered necessary after the completion of collectivisation and socialist construction. These democratic reforms were pushed through by Stalin despite opposition from within the party and wider society — none of this supports the narrative of a dictator determined to solidify his authority through terror.<a href="#fn-12" id="ref-12" class="fn">[12]</a>

  </p>

  <p>
    Stalin did not need to rule by terror because people respected him for what he had accomplished regardless, having played an active role in the Russian revolution and modernising the USSR. No real resistance to Stalin existed in the party and he already had immense power. Most ordinary people did not see themselves as being terrorised by the state and many supported its actions, sincerely believing the claims of wreckers and saboteurs infiltrating all sections of society, even particpating by reporting others to the authorities.<a href="#fn-13" id="ref-13" class="fn">[13]</a><a href="#fn-14" id="ref-14" class="fn">[14]</a> Modern scholarship demonstrates that the Soviet leadership and masses both genuinely believed in plots and conspiracies, whether they truly existed or not; the government had not been fabricating them to terrorise the people and the people did not feel terrorised.<a href="#fn-15" id="ref-15" class="fn">[15]</a> The NKVD in many respects depended on the citizenry as active participants in the repression. In fact, people often felt safer, as they felt that internal enemies were being dealt with.<a href="#fn-16" id="ref-16" class="fn">[16]</a>
  </p>


  <p>
    Arrests were not carried out at random but rather targeted specific social categories. The population and police both believed they were hunting for real enemies, and purges primarily targeted the country's elite — high-level party officials, industrial managers, etc. — as well as known counterrevolutionary elements — including kulaks, former white guards, members of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, etc.<a href="#fn-17" id="ref-17" class="fn">[17]</a><a href="#fn-18" id="ref-18" class="fn">[18]</a><a href="#fn-19" id="ref-19" class="fn">[19]</a> When ordinary workers were affected, it was typically because of connections at some point in a chain of police investigations, whether the crime was real or imagined, as people interrogated by the police would often give other names which the police would in turn investigate.<a href="#fn-20" id="ref-20" class="fn">[20]</a> Additionally, the targets of the purges were not selected because they were "old Bolsheviks".<a href="#fn-21" id="ref-21" class="fn">[21]</a><a href="#fn-22" id="ref-22" class="fn">[22]</a><a href="#fn-23" id="ref-23" class="fn">[23]</a><a href="#fn-24" id="ref-24" class="fn">[24]</a> Purges were far more correlated to their rank in the party — members were purged because they were high-ranking party officials, many of which happened to be old Bolsheviks given their experience and reputation.<a href="#fn-25" id="ref-25" class="fn">[25]</a><a href="#fn-26" id="ref-26" class="fn">[26]</a> The vast majority of old Bolsheviks were left unharmed by the purges, and Stalin and the party leadership were themselves "old Bolsheviks" (including Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, etc.), many having joined the party much earlier than expelled oppositionists, thereby rendering such a claim meaningless.
  </p>

  <p>
    The repression was greatly intensified by the unstable international situation.<a href="#fn-27" id="ref-27" class="fn">[27]</a> Germany, Poland and Japan represented the greatest foreign threats to the USSR, with their imperial ambitions involving its dismemberment into independent states and a world war edging closer. Nazi Germany desired Lebensraum, the total annihilation of Slavic peoples and of "Judeo-Bolshevism". Japan saw the USSR as its largest obstacle to expansion in the Far East, and Poland also saw the USSR as its foremost enemy following the Polish-Soviet War of 1919–1920. These countries collaborated with each other and had numerous spies working throughout the USSR,<a href="#fn-28" id="ref-28" class="fn">[28]</a> actively committing espionage and working with Trotskyites or bourgeois nationalists (primarily in Ukraine, the Caucasus<a href="#fn-29" id="ref-29" class="fn">[29]</a> and Turkestan) to separate republics from the union, most notably through the Promethean Movement,<a href="#fn-30" id="ref-30" class="fn">[30]</a> and aiming to establish a fifth column for a future invasion.<a href="#fn-31" id="ref-31" class="fn">[31]</a> Their efforts failed due to the extensive infiltration and counterintelligence operations by Soviet intelligence agencies. Unlike other European countries, the USSR did not have a fifth column when the Nazis invaded — they had all been shot.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is often asserted that the purges were to such an extent that they caused a severe economic crisis but rather the inverse is true. Significant economic problems — caused by the unstable international situation, crop failure and poor harvests following bad weather, increased military spending to prepare for war, among other factors — accelerated the purges by intensifying the fear of wrecking or industrial sabotage.<a href="#fn-32" id="ref-32" class="fn">[32]</a> The Stakhanovite movement further exacerbated tensions within the factories between workers and managers, resulting in managers being suspected of sabotage when they failed to meet quotas or adequately accommodate workers.<a href="#fn-33" id="ref-33" class="fn">[33]</a> The NKVD's surveillance capabilities are also often vastly overstated. In 1939, the NKVD had 366,000 total employees in a country with a population of 169 million. Of this figure, only a small amount were informers and investigators, as the NKVD had other functions besides surveillance. Only a handful of informers existed in each province and were very inefficient — the apparatus for widespread planned terror simply did not exist and neither did the motive.<a href="#fn-34" id="ref-34" class="fn">[34]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The party was spread thin and its administration in many areas outside of the cities was very weak. Peripheral party organisations were detached from the center, making any sort of planned terror campaign practically impossible. As historian J. Arch Getty described it, "the chain of command collapsed more often than it functioned."<a href="#fn-35" id="ref-35" class="fn">[35]</a> The lower levels of the communist party were often very disorganised, and regional party organisations were poor at record keeping, which became bad enough that in many cases they didn't even know who their members were. This facilitated the entry of careerists and opportunists into the party, which had to be rectified through expulsions.<a href="#fn-36" id="ref-36" class="fn">[36]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Purges were common in the party to expel inactive or unfit members and occurred periodically.<a href="#fn-37" id="ref-37" class="fn">[37]</a><a href="#fn-38" id="ref-38" class="fn">[38]</a> The purges from the 1920s and early 1930s must be distinguished from the 1937–1938 period, referred to as the <strong>Yezhovshchina</strong>. Of all the people expelled in purges in 1935 — which were conducted to rectify organisational problems in the party — the vast majority were nonideological.<a href="#fn-39" id="ref-39" class="fn">[39]</a> Roughly 63% were "passives", i.e. inactive party members who did not attend meetings or pay dues. 20% were former white guards or kulaks. Only 3% were political — Trotskyites and Zinovievites, after the existence of an underground opposition bloc was uncovered.<a href="#fn-40" id="ref-40" class="fn">[40]</a>

  <p>
    All of the major oppositionists that were convicted in the Moscow trials had been organising factions within the party and attacking Lenin and Bolshevism from before the October revolution had even occurred, and they continued this into the 1920s and 1930s, which was merely an escalation of the activity they had always supported.
  </p>

  <p>
    Trotsky was a lifelong oppositionist and anti-Bolshevik, having been a vacillating Menshevik until he joined the Bolsheviks in 1917 only after the Menshevik's revolutionary bankruptcy became clear, and he was in constant opposition to Lenin and other party leaders.<a href="#fn-42" id="ref-42" class="fn">[42]</a> Bukharin, since joining the Bolsheviks in 1906, had also consistently opposed Lenin and the Bolshevik line; Bukharin was an eclecticist heavily influenced by Machism (criticised by Lenin in his work, <i>Materialism and Empirio-criticism</i>),<a href="#fn-43" id="ref-43" class="fn">[43]</a> and held several erroneous positions, namely on imperialism and the national question.<a href="#fn-44" id="ref-44" class="fn">[44]</a> During 1917, Zinoviev and Kamenev were the only two Central Committee members to vote against carrying out the October revolution. Once the vote was passed and they were defeated, they published a letter in a newspaper opposing an uprising, thereby revealing one was being planned in the first place and jeopardising the revolution.<a href="#fn-45" id="ref-45" class="fn">[45]</a> Lenin demanded their expulsion from the party, but they were allowed to remain.<a href="#fn-46" id="ref-46" class="fn">[46]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The first major instance of factionalism in the party following the October revolution occurred in 1918 regarding the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The purpose of the treaty was to end Russian participation in World War 1, as demanded by the masses of workers and peasants. Lenin supported signing the treaty and compromising with the Germans,<a href="#fn-47" id="ref-47" class="fn">[47]</a> but Bukharin, Karl Radek and others had formed the Left Communists faction to oppose the treaty and advocate for revolutionary guerrilla warfare against German forces.<a href="#fn-48" id="ref-48" class="fn">[48]</a> Trotsky did not believe the Germans would launch a resumed offensive and proposed stalling negotiations, but the Germans continued to advance, forcing the Bolsheviks to sign the treaty and make significant concessions to the Central Powers.<a href="#fn-49" id="ref-49" class="fn">[49]</a> The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries launched an uprising against the Bolsheviks following the signing of the treaty. Significantly, Bukharin admitted in a 1924 Pravda article that the Left Communists, of which he was a leader, had planned to arrest Lenin in conjunction with the Left SRs.<a href="#fn-50" id="ref-50" class="fn">[50]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout the 1920s, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Kamenev and Bukharin had continued organising factions within the party,<a href="#fn-51" id="ref-51" class="fn">[51]</a> directly violating party rules forbidding factionalism, beginning with a collective meeting in a cave in 1923 to form an opposition bloc against Stalin's position as general secretary.<a href="#fn-52" id="ref-52" class="fn">[52]</a> To understand the opposition, it is important to understand their theoretical differences.
  </p>

  <p>
    The New Economic Policy (NEP) was introduced in 1921 and temporarily allowed the free market to exist in a very reduced form with only small-scale enterprises being privately owned, while larger enterprises remained state-controlled. Lenin termed it a temporary, strategic retreat in order to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance following the destruction of the civil war and the destabilising effect that war communism had on the peasantry — a much harsher approach adopted during the civil war, involving the total requisition of peasant surpluses, which switched to a tax under the NEP.<a href="#fn-53" id="ref-53" class="fn">[53]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Trotsky had formed the Left Opposition to oppose the NEP and demand the immediate collectivisation of agriculture, which Stalin opposed because he had correctly judged that the conditions were not right at the time given the high dependence on kulak farms — to initiate collectivisation at this time would have involved a full-scale assault on the kulaks, who controlled the vast majority of grain production.<a href="#fn-54" id="ref-54" class="fn">[54]</a> Zinoviev and Kamenev later joined Trotsky as part of the United Opposition. The oppositionists also opposed the idea of socialism in one country,<a href="#fn-55" id="ref-55" class="fn">[55]</a> which they misrepresented as a rejection of internationalism and neglected the revolutionary potential of the peasantry.<a href="#fn-56" id="ref-56" class="fn">[56]</a> Their criticisms were typically levelled at the supposed "bureaucracy"; however, their solution was little more than to replace the current officials with their own supporters.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1925, a supporter of the oppositionists had leaked Lenin's alleged final letters, which were confidential state documents, to the journalist Max Eastman in an attempt to discredit Stalin.<a href="#fn-57" id="ref-57" class="fn">[57]</a> In what became known as the "Lashevich Affair" in 1926, Left oppositionists organised a clandestine meeting in the woods with first deputy war commissar Mikhail Lashevich, aiming to organise their supporters in major factories, educational institutions, state organs and the army.<a href="#fn-58" id="ref-58" class="fn">[58]</a> In 1927, the opposition organised an illegal printing press to distribute their anti-party leaflets before being exposed by police informers.<a href="#fn-59" id="ref-59" class="fn">[59]</a> Zinoviev, Kamenev and Trotsky were all expelled for factionalism and undermining the unity of the party, with Trotsky exiled from the USSR in 1929. Zinoviev and Kamenev were both expelled in 1927 but were later readmitted into the party.
  </p>

  <p>
    After Stalin initiated widespread collectivisation, Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky led the Right Opposition against him,<a href="#fn-60" id="ref-60" class="fn">[60]</a> in support of continuing the NEP and expounding a reformist, evolutionary approach to socialist construction, which abandoned the Marxist theory of class struggle.<a href="#fn-61" id="ref-61" class="fn">[61]</a> At the time, Soviet agriculture was very backwards and had been stagnant since the destruction of the civil war, barely recovering to pre-war levels. Collectivisation was necessary to modernise agriculture in order to improve the lives of the peasants, increase agricultural production and finance industrialisation through exporting surpluses. The Russian peasantry were organised into small, private farms incapable of large-scale production, and the only solution was to merge those small farms into larger units capable of mechanisation and efficient agricultural practices. Stalin had earlier opposed collectivisation as advocated by Trotskyites in the early 1920s because to do so at that point would have been adventurism, but conditions were now appropriate to form widespread collective and state farms, which were now able to replace the kulak output by the output of <i>kolkhozy</i> and <i>sovkhozy</i>.<a href="#fn-54" id="ref-54-2" class="fn">[54]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    In particular, Bukharin had been divulging Politburo secrets to expelled members of the opposition such as Kamenev as part of his conspiracy to remove Stalin as general secretary.<a href="#fn-62" id="ref-62" class="fn">[62]</a><a href="#fn-63" id="ref-63" class="fn">[63]</a> Nevertheless, the Left Opposition had been repeatedly defeated at several party congresses, namely the 14th and 15th congresses, and Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky were repeatedly reprimanded by the Politburo, Central Committee and Central Control Commission for their factionalism and right opportunism.<a href="#fn-64" id="ref-64" class="fn">[64]</a> Stalin's line was widely accepted by the party;<a href="#fn-65" id="ref-65" class="fn">[65]</a> however, the oppositionists could not tolerate this and began to organise underground opposition to undermine the party and government.

  <p>
    In 1932, Martemyan Ryutin had attempted to organise a faction, publishing a platform with express threats to Stalin, whom he denounced as "the gravedigger of the Revolution", and demanding his removal from power "by force", calling for a "struggle for the destruction of Stalin's dictatorship".<a href="#fn-66" id="ref-66" class="fn">[66]</a> Zinoviev and Kamenev were made aware of this document but did not inform the party about the group, leading to their expulsion in 1932.<a href="#fn-67" id="ref-67" class="fn">[67]</a> In the same year, Trotsky in exile and his son, Sedov, had also formed a bloc of dissidents inside the USSR after his attempt to return to the Politburo was ignored.<a href="#fn-68" id="ref-68" class="fn">[68]</a><a href="#fn-69" id="ref-69" class="fn">[69]</a> They had been communicating through letters that had been smuggled in to leading oppositionists such as Karl Radek, Grigory Sokolnikov and Yevgeni Preobrazhensky since 1929. This bloc included Trotskyites and Zinovievites, leaked secret state documents to Western journals, smuggled in copies of Trotsky's <em>Byulleten Oppozitsii</em> ("Bulletin of the Opposition") and ran underground printing presses.<a href="#fn-70" id="ref-70" class="fn">[70]</a><a href="#fn-71" id="ref-71" class="fn">[71]</a> In 1933, Trotsky formally broke with the Comintern and proposed the establishment of a rival Fourth International, openly calling for the forcible overthrow of the Soviet government.<a href="#fn-72" id="ref-72" class="fn">[72]</a> Further letters regarding the activity of this bloc were destroyed, and Trotsky had knowingly lied to the Dewey Commission about its existence.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1934, Sergei Kirov was assassinated, beginning what is understood as the "Great Purges". Kirov was a Stalin supporter responsible for destroying Zinoviev's faction and taking over the Leningrad party organisation.<a href="#fn-73" id="ref-73" class="fn">[73]</a><a href="#fn-74" id="ref-74" class="fn">[74]</a> Investigations led to discovering the existence of illegal, underground opposition networks led by Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotsky and Bukharin, who were all subsequently arrested, tried and executed, with Trotsky being assassinated by the NKVD in Mexico in 1940.<a href="#fn-75" id="ref-75" class="fn">[75]</a> Whether they organised the assassination of Kirov is unclear, but it is known that they worked to undermine the government and oust Stalin.
  </p>

  <p>
    On 19 August 1936, Zinoviev, Kamenev and 14 other defendants were tried. Their testimony implicated the rightists Bukharin, Rykov and Tomsky; an investigation subsequently began but ended due to a lack of evidence.<a href="#fn-76" id="ref-76" class="fn">[76]</a> Following this, Tomsky committed suicide from fear of being discovered and arrested.<a href="#fn-77" id="ref-77" class="fn">[77]</a> A further trial on 23 January 1937 involved Radek, Pyatakov and Sokolnikov, involving charges of espionage and wrecking following a series of mine explosions. Testimony further implicated Bukharin and Rykov, whose trial began on 2 March 1938.<a href="#fn-78" id="ref-78" class="fn">[78]</a> The former director of the NKVD, Yagoda, was also tried as a rightist<a href="#fn-79" id="ref-79" class="fn">[79]</a> who covered up the bloc's activities by failing to disclose the existence of the Bloc of Rights and Trotskyites despite being in possession of clear evidence since 1932.<a href="#fn-80" id="ref-80" class="fn">[80]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Everyone on trial confessed to their actions, including organising assassinations and acts of sabotage. Although the NKVD had been authorised to torture prisoners in certain cases<a href="#fn-81" id="ref-81" class="fn">[81]</a> and many during this time period were, there is no evidence proving that the confessions of these defendants were necessarily extracted through torture; this is only conjecture, and confessions are suitable for convictions in trials in any country, including in the West. In fact, Bukharin's biographer and prolific anticommunist, Steven F. Cohen, admits that Bukharin was not physically tortured.<a href="#fn-82" id="ref-82" class="fn">[82]</a> This explains why Bukharin did not confess to many of the charges put forward by the prosecution, something he would not have done had the entire event been scripted and he had been forced to confess.<a href="#fn-83" id="ref-83" class="fn">[83]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    Nevertheless, even doubting the accuracy of the confessions, we do know that these people organised underground opposition to the government, including with émigrés and at times leaking state documents to foreign countries, openly stating their aim to be the overthrow of the Soviet government. It is not a stretch to believe that these people would resort to terrorism after their earlier oppositional activities had been defeated and they were rejected by the mass of the party. Trotsky always believed that the USSR was still a workers' state but rather a degenerated one with a bureaucratic deformation. In this case, a revolution by the masses was unnecessary and individual terrorism — as Trotsky advocated, "not measures of civil war but rather the measures of a police character" — would be considered acceptable to set it back on the course Trotsky wanted.<a href="#fn-72" id="ref-72-2" class="fn">[72]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Case of the Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization, or the Tukhachevsky Case, involved the trials and executions of a number of officers in the Red Army convicted of treason. There is still no consensus on exactly what happened; however, the most credible explanations for this are that a plot to overthrow the government did in fact exist under the leadership of Tukhachevsky, as a number of army officers have testified (although the exact details vary), or that the Axis powers may have fabricated the plot by passing on incriminating documents in order to weaken the Red Army by linking top generals to themselves and getting them executed. Modern Soviet historiography has been leaning towards the latter.<a href="#fn-84" id="ref-84" class="fn">[84]</a><a href="#fn-85" id="ref-85" class="fn">[85]</a><a href="#fn-86" id="ref-86" class="fn">[86]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The impact of the purges on the Red Army is often overstated. An officer expelled from the army was rarely arrested. Many of the officers that had been purged were later reinstated, and officer procurement had increased to a rate that outpaced discharges as a result of preparations for war. In 1937 and 1938, the proportion of leading officers permanently purged was 6.9–7.7% and 2.3–3.7%, respectively. This is in stark contrast to the erroneous figure of 50% proposed by Robert Conquest, which overestimated the frequency of arrests and underestimated the amount of officers. In 1939, 0.08% were purged. Most of these officers were then replaced, albeit with less experience. This made up for the discharges, making it difficult to accurately estimate their full impact.<a href="#fn-87" id="ref-87" class="fn">[87]</a><a href="#fn-88" id="ref-88" class="fn">[88]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of 1938, the repression largely ceased. Arrests and executions sharply declined with many people being acquitted or readmitted into the party, and there was a return to ordinary judicial practice with greater oversight over the security organs. Yezhov was expelled from his positions, arrested and then executed in 1940 for huge excesses in the repression, alongside many other NKVD officials and police officers who were themselves accused of wrecking. Repression again intensified in 1941 as a result of the Nazi invasion.<a href="#fn-89" id="ref-89" class="fn">[89]</a><a href="#fn-90" id="ref-90" class="fn">[90]</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    The scale of the repression has been greatly exaggerated, and earlier estimates involving millions of executions have now been disproven by archival evidence.<a href="#fn-91" id="ref-91" class="fn">[91]</a><a href="#fn-92" id="ref-92" class="fn">[92]</a> Executions have been estimated to be 700,000 at maximum, and the vast majority of these were from the mass operations described above in which local officials demanded increases to their limits or exceeded them against the direct orders of the central authorities. The total prison and camp population was approximately 2 million at the height of the purges, the vast majority of which were for ordinary criminal offences; only a minority were political.
  </p>

  <h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

  <p>
    All of this points towards a more nuanced understanding of this era in Soviet history as defined by panic at real or perceived threats and sheer chaos, rather than the traditional notion of some well-planned plot to eliminate opposition.<a href="#fn-93" id="ref-93" class="fn">[93]</a> The purges were provoked by the discovery of real, underground opposition groups organising to overthrow the Soviet government, and the ensuing panic resulted in enormous excesses. Nevertheless, Stalin's role cannot be disregarded and we should recognise his mistakes. In many cases he initiated events, even if they didn't turn out as according to some predetermined plan. Stalin was responsible for Yezhov becoming head of the NKVD, leading to many excesses as Yezhov encouraged greater repression. Stalin should not have unleashed mass repression campaigns like those targeting kulaks in 1937, and when he did, he should have made more of an effort to curb excesses and better enforce the established limits. He may not have thoroughly planned the violence but that does not fully absolve him of responsibility, and as Marxists, we must seek to understand both the successes and failures — whether accidental or not — of past socialist experiments.

  <blockquote>
    "We still often read that Stalin thought up his plans with no meaningful influence, constraint, or pressure from anyone else. Proofs continue to be adduced that he was the originator of every important regime initiative. He alone decided what to do and did it, and the outcome was as planned. One assumes that his wishes were always realized and, hypnotized by the strident and uncompromising language of his commands and threats, we rarely stop to wonder why it was necessary to be so threatening or to repeat the threats and commands so often. Even when the outcomes of his policies were dramatically different from what he ordered, we sometimes assume this was what he wanted anyway and the divergence is seen as another example of his exceeding cleverness or devious planning. Writing history thus becomes little more than chronicling his plans and actions. Stalin's terror was almost incomprehensible in its scope and cruelty. But his policy was formulated and administered in complicated ways and, like other policies, can be studied without negating the dictator's role or responsibility." <br>

    The concept of "totalitarianism", that is, of a state that completely dominates society and rules by unrestrained terror, has largely been rejected in modern academia. Even anticommunist scholarship concedes that states do not actually survive without being rooted in society itself and that the USSR did indeed have popular support with widespread participation in governance.<a href="#fn-94" id="ref-94" class="fn">[94]</a><a href="#fn-95" id="ref-95" class="fn">[95]</a><a href="#fn-96" id="ref-96" class="fn">[96]</a><a href="#fn-97" id="ref-97" class="fn">[97]</a> The "revisionist" school of Soviet historians<a href="#fn-98" id="ref-98" class="fn">[98]</a> — J. Arch Getty, Roberta T. Manning, Robert W. Thurston, Sheila Fitzpatrick, Jerry F. Hough, Stephen Wheatcroft, among others — have done substantial research on this era in Soviet history. They have challenged and overturned many outdated notions propagated by historians of the "orthodox" school, the most egregious being Robert Conquest, a former member of the UK government's Cold War propaganda department (the Information Research Department). The work of the "orthodox" historians are dominated by erroneous Cold War narratives based on faulty sources, seeking to justify obsolete and reductive "totalitarian" models from the 1950s with a standard of evidence that would be completely unacceptable in any other field of history, relying foremost on rumours and conjecture.<a href="#fn-99" id="ref-99" class="fn">[99]</a> In contrast, the revisionists have referred to concrete archival evidence that has become available since <em>glasnost</em> in the 1980s. When first beginning their work, the revisionist historians were ruthlessly attacked and slandered as "Stalinists", with many being driven out of their careers as a result of the innate class interests dominating this field of research. However, the arguments of the revisionist historians have now largely been accepted in the field of modern Soviet historiography, rejecting the concept of a single individual responsible for masterminding everything in favour of a more complex view with a lot more chaotic inner-party struggles and a more nuanced relationship of the party to the state and the state to wider society. Revisionist historians are still often anticommunists (their research would likely not be published otherwise) and their works must be analysed critically. Nevertheless, the historical record is now clear, an academic consensus already exists, and there is no excuse for regurgitating outdated and inaccurate explanations of Soviet history.
  </p>

  <p>
    The arguments put forth by many proponents of the totalitarian model originate from defeated oppositionists or triumphant opportunists from the USSR. Among these include Trotsky, who carried out constant smear campaigns against the USSR from exile, or Stalin's successor, Khrushchev, who abandoned Marxism-Leninism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, and slandered Stalin at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party upon coming to power.<a href="#fn-100" id="ref-100" class="fn">[100]</a> These provide convenient authority figures and premade narratives for Western historians to cite to backup their claims.
  </p>

  <p>
    Totalitarianism is merely a convenient label originating from the Cold War used to equate Nazi Germany and the USSR. It has no real substance outside of its propaganda value. There is not a single historical example of a state that sufficiently fits the totalitarian model. Nazi Germany does not meet the criteria either. The Nazi party had widespread support amongst the white population — many white Germans didn't mind being treated as the superior race, with their position in the labour aristocracy afforded by imperialism at the expense of the oppressed masses.<a href="#fn-101" id="ref-101" class="fn">[101]</a> The targets of Nazi repression were specific categories: Jews, ethnic and racial minorities, LGBT people, communists, etc. Terror was not directed against all of society indiscriminately but only towards those who were deemed inferior by the Nazis. Many ordinary citizens were themselves active participants in the repression, often helping the state by reporting Jews and other oppressed groups to the Gestapo.
  </p>

  <p>
    Western media tends to delegitimise certain states by claiming that they impose themselves on the population through terror and do not have any support from the people. Any evidence to the contrary — for instance, in the case of Nazi Germany: the many who voted for the Nazi party, those who participated in mass demonstrations in support of the state, the reporting of persecuted groups to the Gestapo — is all waved away as simply "brainwashing", a very flimsy and reductive dismissal because it presupposes a population unable to think for themselves. In reality, Nazi Germany was not totalitarian either and that makes it much more horrific because, following this train of thought, the blame for the horrible atrocities carried out by the Nazis can no longer be placed on an individual party or leaders within the party but on society as a whole, which has many serious implications, and a proper evaluation of this requires a much deeper analysis than mere indictments of a ruling clique. This is not to say that the USSR and Nazi Germany were comparable in this sense either, for they were mutually antagonistic, with the former having as its aim the liberation of the working class internationally and the latter carrying out genocide against entire ethnic groups, both states seeking the total destruction of the other. Only by rejecting these outdated models can we produce an accurate, nuanced analysis of states and the class societies from which they originate.

While the CIA is of course not an academic source and citing them is mostly for dramatic effect, this description is similarly echoed by J. Arch Getty's <i>Stalin as Prime Minister: power and the Politburo</i> (2005), in which the author compares Stalin and the Politburo to the British prime minister and their cabinet: "Without overlooking some obvious differences, Stalin seems to have functioned rather like a prime minister, with the Politburo as his cabinet. Like strong British prime ministers, he controlled the agenda, led the decision-making process, and formulated the final decisions that were promulgated under the name of the Politburo regardless of the actual discussion and consensus of the meeting (if one were even held). Some of the differences between Stalin’s Politburo and, say, Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet are obvious. Others are less apparent but nevertheless intriguing. First, although Stalin was a dictator, his Politburo functioned much more as a team effort than Western cabinets generally do. When he was on the job in Moscow, he was constantly in contact or meeting with his senior lieutenants (whether or not such encounters were called Politburo meetings) to a much greater extent than typical prime ministers. Almost every day they spent hours together in his office. [...] And thirdly, despite Stalin’s life-and-death power over them, they seem to have exercised much more independent authority than British cabinet ministers. They not only had vast authority over bureaucratic empires, but also Stalin left them in charge while he absented himself for two or three months a year on holiday. It is difficult to imagine another European prime minister leaving his lieutenants so unsupervised, and not only because he knew that they feared him and would obey him. As members of the team, it did not occur to them to defy Stalin because that would mean defying the team, the consensus, the common understanding of the country’s proper direction."
    It is typical of Western literature to call Stalin a dictator while contradicting themselves with their research in the same breath, for such anticommunist boilerplate is a necessity to get your works published without having your career and reputation destroyed, as happened with many aspiring historians of the revisionist school from the 1980s onwards.</li>

One day Trotsky plagiarises from the ideological stock-in-trade of one faction; the next day he plagiarises from that of another, and therefore declares himself to be standing above both factions."</li>
